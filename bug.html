<p>This is a demonstration of an uncommon HTML error.  It involves using a nested `<video>` tag inside of a `<details>` element's `<summary>` tag.  Most browsers will not display the video correctly, and will lead to unexpected behavior.</p><p>The issue is that the `details` and `summary` elements are designed for collapsible content, and placing a video directly within the `summary` can disrupt the expected behavior. </p><code><details><summary><video src="video.mp4" controls></video></summary></details></code>
